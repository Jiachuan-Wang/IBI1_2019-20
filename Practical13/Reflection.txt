This practical was interesting with moderate difficulty. I enjoyed the process of practicing and learning.
Through this practical class, I realized that the importance of vaccination in the so-called herd immunity. Without a certain proportion of immunized populations, infectious diseases will quickly infect almost all the people, as shown by the program simulation. However, the infection ability and lethality of pathogens at different development stages, immunity of different people also need to be considered. Of course, simulation of these factors will be more difficult to process, not only requires higher programming skills, but also requires further study and research.
